To make use of ms2deepscore 2.0.0 for similarity computations models files are needed and available {here}(https://zenodo.org/records/10814307). Only the ms2deepscore_model.pt file is required for msFeaST spectral similarity computations. Once downloaded, this file the path to this file is a required path for the msFeaST pipeline. Positive and negative modes should work equivalently. 

To make use of spec2vec 0.8.0 for spectral similarity computations, pre-trained model files are also needed and available for {positive}(https://zenodo.org/records/10527997) and {negative}(https://zenodo.org/records/10528030) mode data. In both cases, the three files with spec2vec in their filename and extension .model and .npy are needed. Models for a the different modes should be placed into separate folders. The msFeaST pipeline will require the respective folder path to run.
